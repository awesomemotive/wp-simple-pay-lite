It should be simple to accept payments and run your business online. There are many situations in which you don’t need a complicated store, cart or checkout process. You just need a simple payment form that accepts credit cards, debit cards, and other popular payment methods.

In just a few steps, you can be up and running in no time. Simply create a payment form and start accepting credit cards and other payment types on your WordPress site.

Stripe Checkout is a drop-in payment flow optimized for the highest conversion. It’s built for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It’s continuously tested and updated to offer a frictionless payment experience. It’s also PCI DSS compliant and SCA-ready without any changes to your website.

**[Upgrade to WP Simple Pay Pro Now](https://wpsimplepay.com/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)**

WP Simple Pay is a verified member of the Stripe partner program. This program recognizes software that meets Stripe's strict quality requirements and provides users of WP Simple Pay and Stripe with the confidence they need to trust us both with their payment integrations.

Below are a few examples of ways you can set up Stripe payment forms with WP Simple Pay. [See our demo site](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link) to try them out for yourself.

= Payment form drag & drop builder =

Drag and drop to add a custom amount entry, a coupon code field, various custom field types, subscription plan selection, a payment summary and more.

All data entered into these custom fields are stored as "metadata" with each Stripe payment record within your Stripe dashboard, so everything is viewable alongside all payment or subscription plan data.

[Try our custom fields demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/custom-fields/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

= 3 form display types =

Select from the embedded, overlay, or Stripe Checkout payment form display types.

Compare them by trying a few of our demos.

- [Embedded form display](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/embedded-form-display/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
- [Overlay form display](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/overlay-form-display/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
- [Stripe Checkout](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/stripe-checkout/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

= Use Stripe Checkout payment pages =

If you need only minimal payment form customizations and don't need an overlay payment form, you can utilize Stripe's fully-hosted checkout pages for payment. You can set a few options when using Stripe Checkout, but when this option is selected, Stripe dictates what can and cannot be configured on the checkout page as it is served up by Stripe’s servers.

[Try our Stripe Checkout demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/stripe-checkout/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

> We paid developers for several hours to do what WP Simple Pay accomplished in minutes. A no-brainer investment for us.

> Justin McGill, Founder of LeadFuze

= Allow custom amount payments =

Set a one-time amount or let your site visitors pay what they want. Optionally specify minimum and default amounts.

[Try our one-time custom amount demo](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/one-time-custom-amount/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

= Add and customize subscription options =

Connect a payment button to an individual Stripe plan or let your site visitors pick a plan to subscribe to. Add a custom amount option, charge a setup fee or tie into free trials.

Try a few of these subscription demos:

- [Set single plan, user selects plan and adding custom fields](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/subscriptions-basic/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
- [Allow customer or donor to enter a recurring custom amount](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/subscriptions-custom-amount/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
- [Add an initial setup fee or allow a free trial period](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/subscriptions-setup-fees-free-trials/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

You can also set up installment plans to end subscriptions after a specific number of charges.

= Offer discounts with coupon codes =

Percent or amount-off coupon codes added in your Stripe dashboard can be used in your payment forms.

Use with subscriptions or one-time payments, and optionally add a total amount label that updates real-time.

[Try our demos with coupon code fields](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/coupon-codes/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

> I've set up payment processing on over a dozen sites and it usually takes forever just to get up and running. Using WP Simple Pay I was accepting Stripe payments in no time. It’s one of the best decisions I made while launching my new product.

> Mike Taber, Founder of Bluetick

= Add Apple Pay and Google Pay buttons =

Give your site visitors the option to pay using Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Microsoft Pay with a single button in your custom embedded or overlay forms.

Anyone with a browser and device combination that allows one of these options will see the new payment button.

[Try our Apple Pay & Google Pay demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/apple-pay-google-pay/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

= Accept ACH and Alternative Payment Methods =

Give your customers the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with ACH debit payments and take advantage of lower fees. ACH payments on Stripe cost 0.80%, capped at $5, with no monthly fees or verification fees.

[Try our ACH debit payment demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/ach-debit-payment-method/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

Additional alternative payment methods are supported by WP Simple Pay and Stripe, with more on the way. Feel free to explore these demos:

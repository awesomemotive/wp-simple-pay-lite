Easily accept credit card payments on your WordPress site using Stripe Checkout.

== Description ==

It should be simple to accept payments and run your business online. There are many situations in which you don’t need a sophisticated store, cart or checkout process. You just need a simple payment form. Keep it simple with WP Simple Pay.

In just a few steps, you can be up and running in no time. For free! There is no charge for WP Simple Pay. There will just be the Stripe per-transaction fees which vary by country. See [Stripe’s Pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing) for more information.

WP Simple Pay is a _standalone_ payments plugin that connects Stripe with WordPress. Since it’s not an add-on, no other plugins are required. Simply set up a payment form and start accepting credit cards on your WordPress site.

It’s no secret that we believe [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is the best payment processor. Stripe supports many languages, countries and currencies. [Check support for your country](https://stripe.com/global).

[Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) is a drop-in payments flow designed to drive conversion. It’s built for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It’s continuously tested and updated to offer a frictionless payment experience. It’s also PCI DSS compliant and SCA-ready without any changes to your website.

**[Upgrade to WP Simple Pay Pro Now](https://wpsimplepay.com/lite-vs-pro/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=upgrade&utm_term=description)**

WP Simple Pay is a verified member of the [Stripe partner program](https://stripe.com/accept-payments/wp-simple-pay). This program recognizes software that meets Stripe's strict quality requirements and provides users of WP Simple Pay and Stripe with the confidence they need to trust us both with their payment integrations.

Below are a few examples of ways you can set up Stripe payment forms with WP Simple Pay Pro. To see how they would appear and function on your site, [try out our demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=demos&utm_term=description).

= Payment form drag & drop builder =

Drag and drop to add a custom amount entry, a coupon code field, various custom field types, subscription plan selection, a total amount label and more.

All data entered into these custom fields are stored as "metadata" with each Stripe payment record within your Stripe dashboard, so everything is viewable alongside all payment or subscription plan data.

[Try our custom fields demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/custom-fields/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=custom-fields&utm_term=description)

= 3 form display types =

Select from the embedded, overlay, or Stripe Checkout payment form display types.

Compare them by trying a few of our demos.

- [Embedded form display](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/embedded-form-display/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=embedded&utm_term=description)
- [Overlay form display](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/overlay-form-display/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=overlay&utm_term=description)
- [Stripe Checkout](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/stripe-checkout/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=checkout&utm_term=description)

= Use Stripe Checkout payment pages =

If you need only minimal payment form customizations and don't need an overlay payment form, you can utilize Stripe's fully-hosted checkout pages for payment. As of September 13, 2019, the newer Stripe Checkout has replaced the "legacy" Stripe Checkout overlay.

You can set a few options when using Stripe Checkout, but when this option is selected, Stripe dictates what can and cannot be configured on the checkout page as it is served up by Stripe’s servers.

[Try our Stripe Checkout demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/stripe-checkout/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=checkout&utm_term=description)

> We paid developers for several hours to do what WP Simple Pay Pro accomplished in minutes. A no-brainer investment for us.

> Justin McGill, Founder of LeadFuze

= Allow custom amount payments =

Set a one-time amount or let your site visitors pay what they want. Optionally specify minimum and default amounts.

[Try our one-time custom amount demo](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/one-time-custom-amount/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=custom&utm_term=description)

= Add and customize subscription options =

Connect a payment button to an individual Stripe plan or let your site visitors pick a plan to subscribe to. Add a custom amount option, charge a setup fee or tie into free trials.

Try a few of these subscription demos:

- [Set single plan, user selects plan and adding custom fields](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/subscriptions-basic/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=subscription&utm_term=description)
- [Allow customer or donor to enter a recurring custom amount](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/subscriptions-custom-amount/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=subscription-custom&utm_term=description)

You can also set up installment plans to end subscriptions after a specific number of charges.

= Offer discounts with coupon codes =

Percent or amount-off coupon codes added in your Stripe dashboard can be used in your payment forms.

Use with subscriptions or one-time payments, and optionally add a total amount label that updates real-time.

[Try our demos with coupon code fields](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/coupon-codes/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=coupons&utm_term=description)

> I've set up payment processing on over a dozen sites and it usually takes forever just to get up and running. Using WP Simple Pay Pro I was accepting Stripe payments in no time. It’s one of the best decisions I made while launching my new product.

> Mike Taber, Founder of Bluetick

= Add Apple Pay and Google Pay buttons =

Give your site visitors the option to pay using Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Microsoft Pay with a single button in your custom embedded or overlay forms.

Anyone with a browser and device combination that allows one of these options will see the new payment button.

[Try our Apple Pay & Google Pay demos](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/apple-pay-google-pay/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=apple&utm_term=description)

= ACH debit and iDEAL payments =

Give your customers the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with ACH debit payments. ACH debits offer you lower transaction fees than cards.

Other payment methods such as iDEAL are also supported with more coming soon!

[ACH debit demo](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/ach-debit-payment-method/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=apple&utm_term=description) | [iDEAL payment demo](https://demo.wpsimplepay.com/ideal-payment-method/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_content=apple&utm_term=description)

Stripe currently supports [27 languages](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-languages-for-stripe-checkout), [39 countries](https://stripe.com/global), and [135+ currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). WP Simple Pay lets you set the locale (language) for your payment forms as well as the preferred currency and date formats for your site's region.

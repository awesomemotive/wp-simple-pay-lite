Below are a few examples of ways you can set up Stripe payments with WP Simple Pay. [See our payment form templates](https://wpsimplepay.com/templates/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link) to try them out for yourself.

=== 💳 Payment Form Drag & Drop Builder ===

Drag and drop to add a custom amount entry, a coupon code field, various custom field types, subscription plan selection, a payment summary and more.

All data entered into these custom payment fields are stored as "metadata" with each Stripe payment record within your Stripe dashboard, so everything is viewable alongside all payment or subscription plan data.

[View our payment templates](https://wpsimplepay.com/templates/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

=== 💳 3 Payment Form Display Types ===

Select from the on-site embedded, on-site overlay, or Stripe Checkout payment form display types.

Compare them by viewing some of our payment form templates:

- [Embedded on-site payment form](https://wpsimplepay.com/template/multiple-payment-methods-form/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
- [Overlay on-site payment form](https://wpsimplepay.com/template/overlay-payment-form/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
- [Stripe Checkout](https://wpsimplepay.com/template/stripe-checkout-payment-form/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

=== 💳 Use Stripe Checkout Payment Form Pages ===

If you need only minimal payment form customizations and don't need an overlay payment form, you can utilize Stripe's fully-hosted checkout pages to accept credit card payments. You can set a few options when using Stripe Checkout, but when this option is selected, Stripe dictates what can and cannot be configured on the checkout page as it is served up by Stripe’s servers.

View a few of these subscription templates:

- [Opt-in to recurring subscription payments](https://wpsimplepay.com/template/opt-in-subscription-form/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)

You can also set up installment plans to end subscriptions after a specific number of charges.

=== 💳 Offer Discounts with Coupon Codes in Stripe ===

Percent or amount-off coupon codes added in your Stripe dashboard can be used in your payment forms.

Use with subscriptions or one-time payments, and optionally add a total amount label that updates real-time.

[View our coupon code template](https://wpsimplepay.com/template/coupon-code-payment-form/?utm_source=wporg&utm_campaign=lite-plugin&utm_medium=link)
